 Project 3

The program is modularized, based on separate tasks, and I have modularized in such a way that the program itself, can run one, several or all modules, in one go for analyses. A separate test environment is, hence, not needed.

For testing:
- You can comment out and run any of the procedure calls in TestDeepNeuralNetwork()
- A selected amount of plots can be found in /Plots directory, and any other test run, will produce a plot in this directory.
- When run, there will be produced one plot, and for my configuration, you will have to tick-off the plot, before the routing 
  moves to the next test case.
